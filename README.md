# COVID-19-Sentiment-Analysis

OUTLINE: 
The goal of this project was to create a machine learning model that was able to determine sentiment from tweets shared on Twitter. We created a model that was able to determine a tweets sentiment, subjectivity and polarity. We also integrated the use of IMBWatson's Tone Analyzer to take a deeper dive into our data to determine the tone of the tweets (anger, sadness, joy, tenative, confidence, fear and analytical). 

The scripts for the machine learning models can be found in the following locations:

Scripts--> Sentiment_Analysis_Master (jupyter notebook)

Twitter_data --> CSV --> Twitter_API_Data_Analysis (jupyter notebook)

Tone_Analyzer --> Tone_Analyzer (jupyter notebook)

Functionality:

-A linear regression model was utilized to build a sentiment analysis.

-IMBWatson Tone Analyzer was used to disect different tones.

-MongoDB is used to house the results from Twitter's API.

-An overall dashboard displaying visuals built in Tableau.These visuals are live and interactive. 

-Each page in the app has a navbar for navigating the application easily.
 

Below is a quick look at the app:
